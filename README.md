# Random Tree Generator

This project implements core functionality of Python module Turtle. You can make a bunch of art in a more intuitive way then using OCaml's graphics. Check out art.mli/ml for diverse sets of features.

Run `$ make tree` in the command line for see images of random trees!

This project comes from my CS 3110 class final project: maze generator.
Any graphics and image generating functions were implemented by me (apart from OCaml's Graphics module).
